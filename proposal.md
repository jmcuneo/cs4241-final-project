**Team Members:** Parker Frizzle, Darren Ni, Austin Rebello, Brianna Sahagian

**Project Title:** `sᴉɹʇǝꞱ™️`

**Project Description:** A unique take on the game Tetris, where the provided blocks rise up from the bottom of the screen instead of falling. This inverse form of Tetris includes the animation and logic of a normal version:

- Seven classic pieces that interlock together in different combinations to complete rows in the board: the 'L-block', 'J-block', 'S-block', 'Z-block', 'T-block', 'I-block', and 'T-block'
- A game win condition when a certain number of points are achieved; for our application 10000 points indicates a win
- A game loss condition when the pieces cross the red line boundary on the board
- A personal score board tied to each player's username

**Key Technologies:** The key technologies we will use in the development of our game will include:

- MongoDB to keep track of user's accounts and scores, as well as display the highest scores on a separate page

**Project Motivation & Audience:** We want to put a twist on classic Tetris to give players familiar with the game a chance to explore a new gamemode and added challenge. After our Tic-Tac-Toe exploration during ICE03, the group decided that we wanted to continue to pursue simple game development through our A5 application. On our team, Darren and Parker are skilled Tetris players and are familiar with the ruleset and mechanics. Brianna and Austin have played a Tetris-adjacent game called Genius Square. Thus, we thought that this project would fit our team's know-how and interests.
