Project Description:

For our project, we plan on programming a memory game where you have to match pairs of hidden tiles with each other. Ideally, you would have to clear the board within a specified period of time. The time it takes you to clear the tile board will be recorded and posted to a leaderboard. The project also includes a login page to record specific userâ€™s high score. The users can login using Google or Github OAuth and we will be using PassportJS for implementing the authentication logic. Additionally, we would add difficulty levels which would increase the board length and width.

To program this, we are using typescript as our language since everyone is familiar with it. We are using React for the front end with Tailwind and Bootstrap for styling and are using Axios to handle calls to the backend. The backend is using an express framework and will connect to a MongoDB database. We are using Turbo to store and run the frontend and backend in one repository.
