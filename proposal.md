# Group 6 Proposal

## Premise

This project's goal is to create a fun and interactive game which educates users on significant LGBT events and activists. The premise of the game is to match an activist with an associated work (books, protests, etc.)

There will be basic leaderboard functionality, allowing users to login and compete with their friends. Vanilla Javascript will serve as the frontend interface of the application. Authentication will be handled by passportjsâ€™s OAuth implementation. A Mongo database will serve as userdata storage, scores and login information. Express will serve frontend pages, as well as providing endpoints for the various functions of the app. The user interface will be styled using a CSS framework to provide a simple and smooth look.
