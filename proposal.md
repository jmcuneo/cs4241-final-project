## Race-a-Pet

Race-a-Pet is a web-based game where users can create pets and race them against each other. Users will “design” a pet with various features such as animal type, diet, and exercise, which will affect their racing ability. We organized this project in stages to prioritize the primary features and functionality of the website to aid in time management and expectations.

Users can log in or create a new account on a login page. Then they can fill out a form to design their pet. We will use the pet attributes to calculate a race time. After submitting the form, users will be brought to a results page, where they can see the final pet design, race time, and ranking amongst the leaderboard of all pets created. We will also add edit and deleting capabilities to the leaderboard database. 

In regards to technologies, we plan to implement the server with Express and run the database on MongoDB. We also plan to use React components and login using session based authentication. 
In between stages, we would conduct user studies in the form of Think-Alouds. User testing will help us clean up our user interface and make sure that Race-a-Pet is easy to navigate. As developers, we can form tunnel vision and only focus on things that we think are important, but with user studies, we can get feedback to optimize user experience.

Once we complete the features for stage 1 and the user study, we will move on to stage 2 of our project. Users will be able to create multiple pets and keep track of them. We will also add additional features to the form for creating a pet, beyond pet name, animal type, diet and exercise. We will also implement features based on user feedback from the user study.

## Stage 1 (MVP)

- Implementing React
- Express
- MongoDB
- Log-ins 
- Create pet form
    - Owner name - username
    - Pet name
    - Animal type
    - Diet
    - Exercise
- Leaderboard for all user's pets 


## Stage 2

- Keeping track of users and their pets 
- Add more attributes to the pet form


## Stage 3/ Between Stages 

- Conduct a User Study on Features and Styling 
- Make changes based on the outcome of the user study
