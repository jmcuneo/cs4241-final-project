          The goal of the game is to make GoatBucks by clicking the Goat in the
          middle of the screen. You can use your GoatBucks to invest in WPI
          restaurants' food items to generate more GoatBucks. Get as
          much as you can!
        </p>
        <p>
          While typically these games are endless, your time at school isnâ€™t, so
          if you get the max upgrades before you reach the end of your Senior
          Year (by clicking the price next to each food item), then you will win once you graduate!
          Years are based on a set timer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try to improve your high score by getting as many Goatbucks as possible before the timer ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next to each food upgrade, you will find a button with their price and
          what they will yield. If it says 'Per Click', it means that every time
          you click the Goat button, you will that get amount added to your balance.
          If it says'Passive', it means you will get that amount for every
          second that passes (from the moment you buy that upgrade).
