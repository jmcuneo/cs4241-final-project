                  Our project is a web application to facilitate playing in-person games of the card game Magic: The
                  Gathering. While the game itself is played in the real world, there are many values and variables that
                  must be recorded and changed as the game progresses.
            </p>
            <p>
                  The primary purpose of the web application is to manage all of these variables. In addition, our
                  application
                  will allow multiple users to log in and play othe same game, with each user able to view and play the
                  game
                  from their own device.
            </p>
            <p>
                  The game will update in real time, displaying up-to-date information to each player.
                  Our application also allows users to view their own game statistics. As the players log in using
                  GitHub, the application will record the results of each game upon completion, creating a list of
                  statistics that players can view in their profile.
            </p>
