**Description**:

Our project is a website aimed at educating new, first year students about WPI. Our website will host games that are meant to educate users about WPI acronyms, building names, majors, and other[ relevant WPI information](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4373620/Billionaire-university-benefactor-hit-son.html). The user will have to first authenticate with their github (or potentially WPI login) to be able to access the content of our website.

So far, we are planning to have a crossword game with three different difficulty levels which would have users learning more challenging WPI information as time goes on. Also we were planning to have a game of WPI hangman with potential hints to allow for users to test their knowledge in a different way. If we have enough time we are planning to add more games to the website.
