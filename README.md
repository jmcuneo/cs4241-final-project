# WPI Games

An online platform to play hangman, crossword (and in the future more?) games, with Worcester Polytechnic Institute in mind! Designed to educate new-commers to WPI lore, traditions, and terminology, this is great collection of entertaining games to learn more about what goes on here at WPI!

### Turning in Your Project (Due Monday, April 29, 11:59 pm)

**Although the assignment is due at 11:59 pm, you must be prepared to demo your website in class that day.**

Submit a second PR on the final project repo to turn in your app and code. Again, only one pull request per team.

Deploy your app, in the form of a webpage, to Glitch/Heroku/Digital Ocean or some other service; it is critical that the application functions correctly wherever you post it.

The README for your second pull request doesn’t need to be a formal report, but it should contain the following:

1. A brief description of what you created, and a link to the project itself (two paragraphs of text)
2. Any additional instructions that might be needed to fully use your project (login information, etc.)
3. An outline of the technologies you used and how you used them.
4. What challenges you faced in completing the project.
5. What each group member was responsible for designing / developing.
6. What accessibility features you included in your project.

Think of 1, 3, and 4 in particular in a similar vein to the design / technical achievements for A1—A4. Make a case for why what you did was challenging and why your implementation deserves a grade of 100%.

The video described above is also due on Canvas at this time.

## FAQs

**Can I use XYZ framework?**

You can use any web-based frameworks or tools available, but for your server programming you need to use Node.js. Your client-side scripting language should be either JavaScript or TypeScript. Note that the staff may not be able to assist with TypeScript questions.
