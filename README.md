# Final Project

Forgetfulness is a plague that ruins the lives of many. It can be difficult to remember all the things you need to do, especially when you have a lot on your plate. Our memory game trains users in the art of memory so that they will never forget something again. Users face an ocean of tiles with hidden matching numbers. They flip over two tiles at a time to match them and try to match all tiles as fast as possible.

Users log in with GitHub and link their scores to their account. A leaderboard tracks users and their lowest times, so they can compete to have the best memory.

We used React and Tailwind on the front-end to code the site and game.
We used Node.js and MongoDB on the back-end to store and retrieve scores.
We used ???? to authenticate users with GitHub.

4. What challenges you faced in completing the project.
5. What each group member was responsible for designing / developing.
6. What accessibility features you included in your project.

Think of 1, 3, and 4 in particular in a similar vein to the design / technical achievements for A1â€”A4. Make a case for why what you did was challenging and why your implementation deserves a grade of 100%.

The video described above is also due on Canvas at this time.

## FAQs

**Can I use XYZ framework?** 

You can use any web-based frameworks or tools available, but for your server programming you need to use Node.js. Your client-side scripting language should be either JavaScript or TypeScript. Note that the staff may not be able to assist with TypeScript questions.
